    <h3>Why it’s called “toad in the hole”</h3>
    <p>
      Rumour has it that this dish is called “toad in the hole” because the
      sausages nestled among the crispy/puffy yorkshire pudding resembles toads
      peeking out of a hole. I’m not sure I see that. Maybe without my contact
      lenses, or perhaps after a few wines, my imagination might stretch that
      far. But that’s ok! We can just giggle at the name and enjoy the awesome
      eating experience that is toad in a hole!!
    </p>
    <h3>What you need</h3>
    <h4>The sausages</h4>
    <p>
      Pork sausages are traditional though you can really use any type of
      sausages you want – beef, chicken, flavoured, etc. And yes, we are going
      to pan-fry them lightly before popping in the oven because then we have
      sausage drippings to make our gravy = tastier gravy!
    </p>
    <h4>Toad in the hole batter</h4>
    <p>
      The batter used for toad in the hole is actually a Yorkshire pudding
      batter. Here’s what you need to make it (and yes, I explain the mayonnaise
      – trust me!):
    </p>
    <h4>Onion gravy</h4>
    <p>
      Toad in the hole is traditionally served with onion gravy. Starting with
      sautéed onion goes a long way to make the gravy tastier when you don’t
      have a pan of roast meat drippings or a homemade beef stock!
    </p>
    <h3>How to make toad in the hole</h3>
    <p>
      It’s actually very straight forward to make. The secret for a great toad
      in the hole lies more in the method of how it’s made and obviously having
      the BEST Yorkshire pudding batter (thank you Chef Stephen!).
    </p>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Batter – Whisk eggs in a bowl, then whisk in flour until lump free.
        Whisk in water, milk, mayonnaise, salt and pepper. Place in the fridge
        until required.
      </li>

      <li>
        Preheat oven to 220°C/425°F (200°C fan). Put the 1/4 cup beef drippings
        in a 23 x 33cm metal pan (9 x 13"). Place in the oven for 15 minutes to
        melt and become very hot.
      </li>

      <li>
        Brown sausages – Heat the 2 tsp (10g) of drippings in a pan over medium
        high heat. Brown the sausages all over, but keep one side just lightly
        browned (this side will brown more in the oven). Keep them raw inside.
        Remove onto a plate.
      </li>

      <li>
        Assemble – Take batter out of fridge and whisk. Working quickly, take
        the hot pan out of oven. Spread sausages in the pan, lightly browned
        side up, keeping clear of the pan walls (Note 5 for arranging tip). Pour
        the batter in around the sausages.
      </li>

      <li>
        Bake – Bake 25 minutes on the top shelf until the sides puff up and is
        golden brown. The top of the edges should be nice and crispy!
      </li>

      <li>
        Serve immediately with onion gravy! Expect some deflation – though far
        less than typical recipes thanks to the mayo.
      </li>
    </ol>
